# star_wars_visual_encyclopedia
A Star Wars Visual Encyclopedia based on the open source SWAPI (Star Wars API) and images from Wookiepedia.

1. Introduction

This React.js App is created just for fun by me. It grabs its data from the open source API SWAPI (https://swapi.co/)
Images used in the Apps is collected from Wookipedia. There's some images missing still that I couldn't find there.

This is also an experimental App to use the React Hooks. And also using Hooks for Global State Management instead of 
for example Redux or another external library. So this App has global state with React Hooks and no external library.

To test the App locally just download or clone the repo and navigate into the directory.

Then write: npm install

Wait ...

Use npm start to start the App and navigate to http://localhost:3000

The App is based on create-react-app

TODO: Implement Styled Components instead of just regular imported CSS files like now.
